## About the project
In fact, this is a slightly difficult project in extension development.
Generally, chrome extensions cannot call or access other extensions.
Only self-developed extensions can communicate in the form of sending and receiving notifications.
To solve this problem, we used an auxiliary program that supports extension.
This cannot be realized with only general extension development technology and can be solved only with low-level technics such as operating system, Windows API, and C/C++.
